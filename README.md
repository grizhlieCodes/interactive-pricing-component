My purpose of completing this challenge was to learn some css needed for styling
an input element with a type of range as well as creating some content for a new

## Notes

I don't think I paid any special attention towards accessibility in this
solution apart from a heading that can be read by screen-readers. I just wanted
to practice some specific basics whilst coming back from my holiday!
